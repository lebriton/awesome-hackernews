## Adding a new project to the list

All instructions for adding a new project to the list are enumerated in [.github/pull_request_template.md](pull_request_template.md).

Anyway, here is the general procedure to follow:

1. [Edit the README.md file](https://github.com/bminusl/awesome-hackernews/edit/main/README.md) in your favorite text editor.
2. Insert the new entry in the right place and following the correct format. [`scripts/format_entry.sh`](../scripts/format_entry.sh) can be invoked to help you.
3. Save and commit.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Fill out the pull request template.
6. Submit it.
7. Wait for review and approval.
8. Celebrate. ðŸŽ‰

Repeat these steps for each project to add.

**Be rigorous and responsive for a smooth review process.**
